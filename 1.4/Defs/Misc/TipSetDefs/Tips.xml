    <tips>
      <!-- Quests -->
      <li TKey="SoSTipScan">Once in orbit, colonists can scan at a ship's science console to discover orbital quest sites. Send colonists in a shuttle to visit them.</li>
      <li TKey="SosTipAICore">Once in orbit, advanced sensors will automatically scan for orbital quest sites. Multiple cores can speed this process along.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipAsteroids">Asteroids are a great source of building materials in space, but beware of what may lurk inside...</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipDebris">The skies of most rimworlds are filled with orbital debris. Some may even contain survivors of the ship's crew, now crazed and cannibalistic.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipSatellites">Clever starship captains can hijack ancient satellites to control weather or bombard their foes. This risks triggering mechanoid-based defenses, however...</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipJTDrive">Johnson-Tanaka drives are typically only found on the largest ships, such as interstellar passenger liners.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipSpaceBugs">Ages ago, genetic engineers created colonies of vacuum-adapted insects intended to mine asteroids. This was not a good idea.</li>

      <!-- Combat -->
      <li TKey="SoSTipNoWeapons">An unarmed ship is easy prey. Install weapons before launching, or bring a shuttle and a competent boarding party.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipHeatsinks">Heatsinks are critical to a ship's performance in combat. More heat capacity means your shields will stay up longer.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipRadiators">A ship can't radiate heat while its cloaking device is active. Make sure to disable it once your ship becomes dangerously hot.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipBoardingParties">Enemy ships will launch boarding parties once their weapons have broken your hull. You can use point defense capable ship weapons to help repel boarders.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipBoardingParties2">In combat, you can send a shuttle over to the enemy ship. Many ships are vulnerable to a skilled boarding party.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipHackBridge">A colonist can use the Intellectual skill to hack an enemy ship's bridge, placing it under your control. Some captains weld multiple captured ships together.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipDetach">Pieces of a ship separated from its bridge will detach and drift away. Their resources can still be recovered by a salvage bay after the battle.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipRange">Ship railguns are best at long range. Plasma weapons can be used at medium range or closer. Lasers are only effective up close.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipTorpedo">A well-placed torpedo can overload shields and shatter hull, assuming it isn't intercepted by point-defense weaponry.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipSpinal">Spinal-mount cannons deal more damage, and produce larger explosions, the more amplifiers they contain.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipEngines">Larger ships require more engines to move quickly in combat. Often a small, nimble ship can outrun a heavily-armed opponent.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipSalvage">Each salvage bay can harvest one tonne of material from a defeated ship. Build multiple bays to efficiently salvage larger ships.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipAbandon">When your ship is defeated in combat, any crew inside auto-eject caskets will land somewhere on the planet below. There, your story can begin anew.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipAirlocks">When boarding an enemy ship, its airlocks can be breached with the Melee skill or hacked with the Intellectual skill.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipCombatPower">The more combat-capable your ship is, the more likely you are to be challenged by formidable enemies.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipEmergencyPurge">An emergency purge port can eject molten silver into space, quickly reducing a ship's stored heat - albeit at a fantastic cost.</li>

      <!-- Shuttles -->
      <li TKey="SoSTipShuttles">Shuttlecraft come in three sizes. Only the smallest among them is powered by chemfuel; larger cargo shuttles require nuclear fuel.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipShuttleBay">Shuttle bays allow cargo and passengers to enter a ship without ever risking vacuum exposure.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipFullyFueled">A shuttle must be fully fueled to travel to or from orbit. When traveling between ground sites, they are slightly less fuel-efficient than transport pods.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipHoverMode">Shuttlecraft can be placed in "hover mode" to act as pack animals for caravans. They will consume fuel slowly in this mode.</li>

      <!-- Misc ship stuff -->
      <li TKey="SoSTipVacuum">Vacuum exposure is not fun. Be sure to have EVA suits on hand in case of a hull breach.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipLifeSupport">A ship only needs one life support system, but having a backup can save your crew in an emergency.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipInterstellar">To travel between planets, you'll need a Johnson-Tanaka drive, a ship computer core, and lots of stored energy.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipReactor">Ship reactors can be overdriven, increasing their power output at the risk of fire and radiation exposure.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipCapacitor">Ship capacitors contain an integrated fuse system, preventing short-circuit events.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipHydroponics">Thanks to hydroponics and artificial soil substrates, it is possible to build a fully self-sustaining colony in orbit.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipMood">Most colonists are excited to go to space, and even more so when on EVA. Wimps and undergrounders, however, will be terrified.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipSensors">Ship sensors can remotely observe maps, allowing you to plan attacks in advance or scout landing sites.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipLanding">In order to land, ships require an area free of buildings, chunks, and creatures.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipTradeShips">Occasionally you will encounter trade ships in orbit. You can attempt to pirate them, but expect bounty hunters to pursue you as your notoriety rises.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipResources">Useful resources are surprisingly abundant in space. You might want to launch a small ship at first, then gradually expand it.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipCrittersleep">Crittersleep caskets can store many small animals, such as cats or puppies. You will need to anesthetize them first.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipFloors">Floors can be built atop ship hull tile. Your gold-paneled bridge will be the envy of every lesser captain.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipHolodeck">The holodeck can train any skill, depending on the program your colonist selects when using it. More advanced holodecks train skills faster.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipCloak">The cloaking device prevents enemy ships from noticing you. It is useless once combat has already begun, however.</li>
	  <li TKey="SoSFormgel">A modern replacement for antiquated hologram technology, formgels are swarms of mechanites which mimic biological human bodies.</li>

      <!-- Archotech -->
      <li TKey="SoSTipArchotechSpore">Spacer legends tell of archotech spores - ship computer cores that have begun upgrading themselves into archotechs. Usually this requires mental contact with an existing archotech...</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipSporeMood">Archotech spores are temperamental beings, and will play "pranks" on their crew if their mood dips too low.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipSporeSacrifice">You can improve an archotech spore's mood by having colonists meditate nearby, or by giving it the brain of a prisoner to examine. This kills the prisoner.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipSporeGifts">An archotech spore will sometimes offer its human progenitors gifts. The more technologies it has unlocked, the more gifts are available.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipPillars">In order to quickly evolve into a full archotech, an archotech spore can reverse-engineer artifacts known as Pillars. Four are known to exist on the Rim, all well-guarded.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipEndgame">No lesser being can stand against an archotech. Once your archotech spore completes its evolution, the world will be yours.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipPsychicField">Once the appropriate research has been completed, an archotech spore can generate a wide range of psychic phenomena upon request.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipArcholife">"Archolife" creatures were designed by an archotech spore. They resemble mundane animals but do not need to eat, are effectively immortal, and even generate a shield in combat.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipFlayer">The Psychic Flayer is a dreaded weapon employed by the most advanced starships. It can stun dozens of crew at once, allowing boarding parties to do their work unopposed.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipMechanites">Shipeater mechanites can consume almost any solid material, but will be disabled by firefoam or water.</li>
      <li TKey="SoSTipRecyclotron">Invented by an archotech spore, the Recyclotron is capable of taking apart nearly any object at 100% efficiency.</li>

      <li TKey="EclecticIsBestCat">The archocat was designed in the image of "Eclectic" - an early 21st-century housepet universally regarded as history's most lovable cat.</li>
