A storm of micrometeorites has torn several breaches in your ship's hull and destroyed its Johnson-Tanaka drive. Trapped in orbit above an unknown rimworld, you must patch up your damaged ship and make long-term survival plans.\n\nPerhaps you can acquire resources by scanning for orbital sites. You could also turn your sensors towards the planet's surface to scout a potential landing site for your ship. One way or another, you will need to reinvent the technologies needed to properly repair it.</text>

    <description>Your colonists were among the millions who died during this rimworld's apocalyptic wars. As society collapsed around them, the extremely wealthy built "Afterlife Vaults" to house the brains of their deceased loved ones. Only a few were completed, and with the collapse of the global power grid their AIs generally decided to enter hibernation.\n\nNow, centuries later, the AI has concluded that rescue will never come. Your afterlife caskets are capable of generating formgels - swarms of mechanites which mimic the original bodies of the deceased - but power supplies only suffice to run one or two at a time.\n\nCan you secure a future for the long-dead?</description>

In any case, you are all well and truly dead, casualties of this rimworld's apocalyptic wars.\n\nBefore society collapsed, your wealthy loved ones secured you a spot in one of the new "Afterlife Vaults," with the promise of your revived brain being able to interact with the world as a formgel - a swarm of mechanites which perfectly imitates your original body. And wouldn't you know it, the outlandish promises all turned out to be true.\n\nOf course, that was before the collapse of the global power grid. Over the centuries, the mechanoids guarding your tomb have one by one failed or been destroyed. The AI has finally calculated the odds of rescue to be negligible, and re-enabled your consciousnes.\n\nAt the moment, there is only enough power to run one or two formgels at a time. Can you build out power infrastructure and secure a future for the dead?</text>
