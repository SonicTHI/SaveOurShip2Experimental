		<discoveredLetterTitle>About: Launching the ship</discoveredLetterTitle>
		<discoveredLetterText>Escaping from this planet - it would be freedom at last, and maybe a return home.\n\nBut before you can even consider interstellar spaceflight, you'll need to reach orbit. The minimum requirements for a spaceworthy craft are a rocket engine, a ship bridge and basic sensors. To survive in space, your colonists will also need either a life-support system or EVA suits.\n\nThe amount of chemfuel required to launch a ship into orbit depends on its size. Larger ships may need multiple engines.</discoveredLetterText>
