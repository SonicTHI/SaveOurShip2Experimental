	<GameOverShipPlanetLeaveIntro>You've set out to a new planet!\n</GameOverShipPlanetLeaveIntro>
	<GameOverShipPlanetLeaveEnding>Your machine persona will now navigate your ship out of planetary orbit. It might find a prosperous planet in this system. Or, it may undertake a centuries-long journey to another star. It might even decide to hide under ice on an asteroid for a few thousand years, waiting for someone to build a new glitterworld here.\n\nYou can however take matters into your own hands by starting a new colony, editing the scenario, adding a "Load ship" part and selecting your ship.</GameOverShipPlanetLeaveEnding>
	<ShipAbandonColoniesWarning>You are about to embark on a journey spanning years or decades, during which time no communication with your planet-bound colonies will be possible. It is unlikely they will be able to survive on their own.\n\nFurthermore, any colonists or animals aboard the ship will not survive the journey unless they are in cryptosleep.\n\nGive this order only if you are willing to abandon everyone and everything left behind.</ShipAbandonColoniesWarning>
	<ShipAbandonColoniesWarningPK>Due to the incoming planetkiller, you will not be able to return to this world.\n\nFurthermore, any colonists or animals aboard the ship will not survive the journey unless they are in cryptosleep.\n\nGive this order only if you are willing to abandon everyone and everything left behind.</ShipAbandonColoniesWarningPK>
	<ChooseAllyToTakeColony>Before you leave, you can send a message to an allied faction, offering them your colony's buildings and any colonists left behind. Should you ever return to this planet, you may find that your former colony has become a thriving settlement of that faction.</ChooseAllyToTakeColony>

	<SoSHibernateWarningStandalone>The drive is ready to begin discharging its stored momentum. Once this is done, your colonists will be able to safely disassemble the drive and retrieve its Entanglement Manifold.\n\nThe process will take about 15 days, and the energy signature will be detectable from a long distance away. This sort of energy signature indicates interstellar flight capability, and will attract gangs of desperate raiders and swarms of deadly mechanoids.\n\nYou will be assaulted with an intensity you've never seen. Make sure your defenses are prepared first.</SoSHibernateWarningStandalone>
