# SaveOurShip2Experimental

**READ CAREFULLY AND IN FULL BEFORE DOING ANYTHING:**

SOS2 EXPERIMENTAL is the maintained version of [Save Our Ship 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1909914131). It includes over a years worth of bugfixes, performance optimizations, mechanics changes and some new features that might need more testing.

**As of V69, 1.3 version is no longer maintained.**

**While this version is official you use it at your own risk.** It is backwards compatible with the STEAM release however it adds features that might not get adopted into the STEAM version and might cause issues when trying to move from SOS2EXP back to STEAM. While most of these issues can be solved with the dev mode or some minor save editing, no support will be provided in this case.

**Make a separate save while NOT IN A SHIP BATTLE before switching to this version and unsubscribe from SOS2 on STEAM!**

**To download the latest build click above: Code -> Download ZIP.** With major changes a stable build might also be available under Releases.

When updating to a new SOS2EXP version: Make sure to delete the old folder then extract the new one.

You can report issues or give feedback here or in #save-our-ship on [Radian Helix Media discord](https://discord.gg/GK7nqgu) - **read the server rules and mention that you are using the experimental build**. **Make sure you are on the latest version, check the [SOS2EXP dev sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XSeMCsOtBsbAOLYFbgYUpxyV4ot8L2pSeWMTwzAUCiM/edit#gid=0) before reporting and if possible try replicating the bug with only the required mods installed**.

An updated version of the Creation kit is also [available](https://github.com/SonicTHI/SaveOurShip2CreationKit). Only use it with SOS2EXP.

Also check [the official SOS2 sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT1tWMpG9R7bU6asg5ICf6AmQGzUHmxnL8OPOWFzV1o4L_Dsli6OQbHfFXY4CTxX6vpCEvJjycMPniB/pubhtml) for general SOS2 info, FAQs and mod compatibility. Note that some mods that do work with the STEAM build might not with SOS2EXP - particularly mods that alter, extend or otherwise interact with SOS2.

**MAJOR FEATURE LIST:**

* **Continue playing or start fresh:** the new release is backwards compatible but your ship might require some maintenance such as replacing large bridges with consoles, adding coolant tanks for more capacity or making more room for a larger crew. Making a save out of combat is recommend just in case. If however you plan to start on a ship you can pick from a varied selection of rebuilt options by customizing your starting scenario.

* **Rebuilt ship roster:** almost every ship in the mod has been redesigned and built from the ground up utilizing new systems and mechanics making for a more interesting and varied experience. New ships and fleets have also been added. Many thanks to the ship wrights that helped with this: HG, Oninnaise, UrbanMonkey, VVither_Skeleton.

* **Ship blueprints:** sold by weapon merchant ships. These items allow you to build entire ships and are fully reusable. You will still need the required technologies and resources to do so (these are listed on each blueprint).

* **Ground defense:** all small ship weapons are now capable of firing on enemy combatants while your ship is landed. Decimate hordes of enemies with the push of a button so long as they are not already too close or your weapons on cooldown.

* **New boarding system and defense:** enemy ships will now send pods directly to your ships outer rooms (this can be disabled in options). Once aboard they will breach doors and attempt to murder your crew. You can escape this fate by utilizing PD weapons to shoot down enemy pods in flight but beware - enemy ships can do the same to you.

* **Redone heat system:** simplified, with less cheese and far better performance. Radiators have been removed while heatsinks now vent heat through the roof even when shielded. Coolant tanks have been added that offer a much larger heat capacity but without the ability to vent it to space.

* **Reworked salvage system:** gone are the days of pushing a button and getting a shipload of resources. Use salvage bays to drag defeated ships to your map, repair or deconstruct them for resources or simply let them burn up in atmosphere. A larger crew or taking advantage of other mods or new mechs in Biotech will come in handy.

* **Bridge system overhaul:** old large bridges have become obsolete with two new consoles taking on and expanding the functionality. Some functions like scanning have been moved to advanced sensors or the new science console while the tactical variant lets you select various weapons types across your ship provided they are connected to it by the ships heat network.

* **Docking ports:** allow you to temporarily connect ships by using extenders with breathable air up to 3 tiles away and can also connect to each other.

* **Performance optimizations:** from faster EVA checks to a completely rebuilt ship combat system - a lot has been done to improve the performance of this mod.

* **New UI:** now sits bellow your pawn bar, showing all ships and can be adjusted in the settings.

* **Tons of minor adjustments, balance changes and bugfixes.**

* **Extendability:** while not perfect it is now easier to mod in new types of ship buildings or adding EVA functionality to other mods.

* **Creation kit:** now includes new tools for fleet and blueprint creation as well as improvements to existing ones.
